# Sorting Visualizer

There are some python scripts which can visualize several famous sorting algorithms and generate the animations via Matplotlib.

(You can also experience the [webpage edition](https://zamhown.github.io/sorting-visualizer).)

## Environment Configuring

* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which includes it.
* Install [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) via pip. However, if you have installed Anaconda before, you needn't install Matplotlib any more.
* If you need export the animations of sorting algorithms as MP4 files, you should download an offical release of FFMpeg (there is [the link](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)). Taking Windows for example, after downloading, extract it to anywhere, and add `[your_path]/ffmpeg/bin` to the environment variable `PATH` to ensure you can run the command `ffmpeg` directly in CMD.

## Usage

Under the root directory of the project, run the commands like the following format to call all functions:

```
python output.py arg1 [arg2 [arg3]]  
```

Details of the three arguments above:

* There are three posible options as "*arg1*":
  * `play` : Play an animation of a specific sorting algorithm or all algorithms in a new window, as a "figure" to Matplotlib.
  * `save-html` : Save the animation as a HTML page with a sequence of images.
  * `save-mp4` : Save the animation as a MP4 video.
* There are nine posible options as "*arg2*":
  * `all` *(default)* : Show the visualization of all sorting algorithms in the animation.
  * `bubble-sort` : Only show the visualization of bubble sorting algorithm in the animation. The following arguments have similar functions.
  * `comb-sort`
  * `heap-sort`
  * `insertion-sort`
  * `merge-sort`
  * `quick-sort`
  * `selection-sort`
  * `shell-sort`
  * `oddeven-sort`
  * `para-oddeven-sort`
  * `radix-sort`
* There are four posible options as "*arg3*":
  * `almost-sorted` : Sort an almost-sorted sequence.
  * `few-unique` : Sort a few-unique sequence.
  * `random` *(default)* : Sort a random sequence.
  * `reversed` : Sort a descending sequence.

For example, run `python output.py play heap-sort reversed` to create a new window to play the animation of sorting, which use heap sorting algorithms and sort a descending sequence.

There's nothing else need to be introduced. Have fun!
